# Changelog

## 1.3

Major new features and code restructure

* The app is now running on a Backbone Router allowing for multiple views to be rendered in the same page.
* Added a whole new calculator, the **Weighted Interest Calculator** at `#weighted-interest` which helps you figure out your interest rate.
* Also added this changelog.

## 1.2

Fixed a bug that caused additional calculations after the first to append the new set of rows to the bottom of the table rather than reset the table first.

## 1.1

* Optimized payment row rendering performance
* Changed how and when views are rendered.

## 1.0

Inadvertently silent release (I forgot to update `package.json` so nowhere in the version history does it ever read `1.0`)

* Interest is calculated to make it more accurate.

## 0.9

First public release
