# Amortization Calculator

When are you going to pay off your student loan? How much could you save if you just paid $25 or $50 more a month? Arm yourself with the knowledge you need to quickly pay off your student loans with this amortization (loan payoff) calculator.

## Notes about Calculations

* Interest is calculated once monthly and things like your exact payment date during the month is not taken into consideration. If your loan provider does things differently, these values may not be accurate for you.
* **This is for the purpose of making estimates and semi-informed financial decisions only. I'm not liable for any decisions you make, nor will I stand by any of these calculations at any time.**
