# Amortization Calculator

When are you going to pay off your student loan? How much could you save if you just paid $25 or $50 more a month? Arm yourself with the knowledge you need to quickly pay off your student loans with this amortization (loan payoff) calculator.

## Notes about Calculations

* Interest is calculated once monthly and normalized as 1/12 of your interest rate. If your loan provider does things differently, these values may not work for you.
* Note that because interest is calculated as 1/12 of the rate, February (28 days), March (31 days) and April (30 days) will all have the same calculated interest increase on the same amount of money. I may fix this eventually.
* **This is for the purpose of making estimates and semi-informed financial decisions only. I'm not liable for any decisions you make, nor will I stand by any of these calculations at any time.**
